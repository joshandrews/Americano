Americano
===================
This is a simple, lightweight blogging system (and site template) written using web.py.  There are a few main things you need to know in order to get Americano up and running for yourself.

The site comes with an install script to get you off the ground.  Just run the site (using `python site.py 8080 --dev`) and go to the site in your browser.  It will immediatly redirect you to the install script.  When installing you will need your admin MySQL username and password - but don't worry, it won't store it.  Once installed you must do the following to personalize the site:
- Make work pages
	- These are located in the work-pages directory and you can edit the sample ones to get you going.  The url of the work pages will be the name of the html file.
	- You must also manually link them (for now) from the work index page
- Edit home page text
	- This can be done by editing index.html

After that you should be up and ready to go.  Enjoy!
